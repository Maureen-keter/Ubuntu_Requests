# Ubuntu-Inspired Image Fetcher

**The Wisdom of Ubuntu: "I am because we are."**

This project is a simple Python script that demonstrates Ubuntu’s values of community, respect, and sharing by fetching images from the internet and saving them locally.

## Features

* Prompts user for an image URL.
* Downloads and saves the image into a `Fetched_Images` directory.
* Handles errors gracefully.
* Automatically creates the directory if it doesn’t exist.

## Requirements

* Python 3
* `requests` library (`pip install requests`)

## Usage

```bash
python image_fetcher.py
```

Enter the image URL when prompted. The image will be saved inside the `Fetched_Images` folder.
